[KrakelOrakel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakel_Orakel) is a collaborative drawing game similar to 
- [Pictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictionary#Gameplay)
- [Scribbl](https://skribbl.io/)
- [Drawception](https://drawception.com/)
- [GarticPhone](https://garticphone.com/)
- [Montagsmaler](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Montagsmaler)

Basically, you draw a given word and others have to guess it (more or less).
The unique aspect of KrakelOrakel is that
- it is collaborative
- you do not need to be able to draw well

## Game Rules

1. First, everyone gets a board with lines on it as well as a secret word.
1. Then, you draw the word on your board by only using the provided lines.
1. After everyone is done, the hidden words are mixed and the same amount of additional words are added.  Hence, for 8 players, there are 16 words in total.
1. The words are revealed to everyone and one after the other needs to select a word that they do not see on the drawn boards.
1. The group penalty score is how many wrong words are left in the end.
1. For a new round, the boards are cycled around to the next player and a new word is drawn.
